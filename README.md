This mod retextures items from vanilla Arma 3 and [RHS](https://youtu.be/lJN5EqldH7M) to be used by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. factions. The retextures were specifically made to be compatible with [S.T.A.L.K.E.R. + CBRN Equipment](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1996610193) in terms of looks.

Current the mod adds items for the following factions as they are the ones lacking the most:
- Duty
- Military
- Clear Sky

This mod was made mainly for my own campaign and projects but anyone is free to use it and contribute to it on the [github](github.com/Nomas-X/STALKER_Retextures) if they wish to.
## What Does It Contain?
- 19x Headgear
- 16x Uniform
- 11x Vest
- 4x Backpack
- 4x Facewear

It is important to note that most of the items are simple variations of each other.
